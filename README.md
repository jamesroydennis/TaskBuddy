# TaskBuddy: Intelligent Voice Memo Task Manager 🎤📝✨

This repository hosts **TaskBuddy**, a sample project demonstrating a sophisticated task management system. While starting as a foundational task list, TaskBuddy aims to go a significant step above standard task managers by integrating cutting-edge features:

* **Voice Memo Integration:** Seamlessly record and associate voice memos with your tasks, moving beyond simple text-based entries. 🗣️➡️📋

* **Intelligent Memo Parsing:** Leverage advanced capabilities to parse and understand the content of recorded voice memos. 🧠🔍

* **AI-Powered Metadata Organization:** Utilize Artificial Intelligence to automatically extract and organize key metadata from your voice memos, making your tasks smarter and easier to manage. 🤖📊

This project is being built from the ground up with a strong focus on core software engineering principles:

* **SOLID Principles:** Adhering to Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. 🏗️✅

* **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Ensuring robust and reliable code through a "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle. 🧪🚀

* **Dependency Injection (DI):** Achieving loose coupling and enhanced testability via an Inversion of Control (IoC) container. 🔗💉

Stay tuned as we build out these exciting features! 🚧🚀
